## Key Takeaways

- **Automation**  
  Destination lists allow for the automation of access to multiple domains and IPs, simplifying the management of access rules.
- **Access Control**  
  By using destination lists, organizations can efficiently control access policies, allowing or blocking access as needed.
- **Ease of Management**  
  Creating and modifying destination lists offers a structured approach to adding or removing access points, making it easier to manage large sets of destinations.
- **Integration**  
  Destination lists can be integrated into broader access policies, enhancing security measures by defining which destinations are allowed or blocked in various scenarios.

Hello and welcome to the Cisco DNet channel. Today we continue with a series that highlights the latest cloud security API features. In today's episode, we will be diving into destination lists together with Yaron Caspi, API product manager at Cisco. Hi Yaron. Hi Oleksii, thanks for having me. So what's on our list today? Funny you should mention that. As you mentioned, destination lists are a type of list in secure access. And destination lists specifically allow you to manage large amounts of access to destinations like domains, URLs, and IPs. But why would you even need a list? Why not add a destination directly? That's a great question. You could do that if you only had, you know, like a handful of destinations. But usually, these lists are used in order to automate access. Either allowing access or blocking access for large amounts of destinations. That becomes very, very tricky from a, you know, access rule level. Because if that rule is now full of tons and tons and tons of destinations, it not only becomes difficult to manage, but it's also very difficult to basically prune and also to handle the ability to add and remove destinations from it. A list provides kind of like a layer which can group together different types of destinations. Let's see what those look like. So I'm just going to share my screen here. And as with any API requests, we first have to exchange our key and our secret for an access token. This is auth type access. Once we've done that, I can just do or set my access token variable to this access token. And then we can actually get started. So the first thing that we're going to do here is we're going to add a brand new destination list. So if you look at the request over here, right, we're hitting api.sse.cisco.com policies v2 destination lists. And what we're doing here is we are using in terms of authorization, we're using the access token we just added, we're putting in a content type header of application JSON. And in our data payload, we're putting in the details for the new list, right. So we're putting in a name called new destination list 123456. And we're going to hit enter. And we're basically going to get a 200 for this. So now we have a brand new destination list. Notice, by the way, that we don't have any destinations in that list right at this moment. So let's fix that. Let's add destinations. We're going to do this by basically hitting destination lists, we're going to use the ID for our new destination list over here. And then we're going to basically hit destinations. So let me just copy this over here, a little typo over there. But anyway, just to explain in the meantime, right, so we're basically hitting destination list, and then we're hitting the ID for that, for the specific destination list we just created, right, that's that 18307304. And then we're hitting destinations, right, that's the ultimate name of the resource. So and then what we're doing here is in our payload, we're determining the name of the different destinations. In our example, what we're doing is we're adding internet badguys.com as our first destination. And we have a comment here, you can see it's just a placeholder, we could put in any comment we wanted, instead of enter a comment. What we see some customers do is use this in order to identify the originating system that is making this request, right. So if this is coming from an SOAR, or a SIM, or whatever, you can identify that you can also identify the actual user, it just depends on what you want to put it in. It's free text, okay. And then we're adding another destination in this array called internet badguys2.com, right. So we're going to hit enter there, we got a 200 for this request as well, that means the request succeeded. And then what we're going to do is we're just going to make a third call to take a look at the content of that destination list. So we're just going to copy, we're going to copy in the request, we're going to copy in the ID of the destination list, and remember destinations, right. And then we're just going to fill in the blanks in terms of the code and the headers. All right, so now within this destination list, we have two destinations, you can see they're automatically identified as domains, right, we've got internetbadguys.com, and internetbadguys2.com with their comments. All right, that's it. Yeah, so now I have destinations in the list. So what do I do now? That's a great question. So now what you can do is you can take this list, and you can attach it to any of your access policy rules. Thus adding the enforcement layer, right, and determining whether these would be allow or blocks. And we'll hopefully look at that in a future video. Thank you, Yaron. Thanks, Oleksii.
